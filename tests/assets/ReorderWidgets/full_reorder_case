# This file contains test case composed of the following tags:
#     * # (coments): Lines starting with this character would be ignored.
#     * arguments: is set of words separated by spaces that can later be parsed
#     * board: represent a workspace, the first line is the dimensions of the board width x height (wxh)
# There are different characters on the board that represent different things:
#     * x: The x character represents spaces that would be ignored, for example it can be used in
#          the first row if we don't know how wide the smartspace is.
#     * i: Represents an icon on the workspace, none in particular just an icon
#     * [a-z]: Represents a widget and it can be any number or character
#          except any other already in use. The whole continuos are of the same character is the
#          area of the widget.
#     * [A-Z]: Represents a folder and number of icons in the folder is represented by the order of
#          letter in the alphabet, A=2, B=3, C=4 ... etc.
# Test are parsed by CellLayoutTestCaseReader.java and boards are parsed by CellLayoutBoard.java
