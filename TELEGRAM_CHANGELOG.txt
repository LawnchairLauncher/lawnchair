After about 2 long years, we're delighted to announce that <b>Lawnchair 14 has finally arrived!</b>

Based on Launcher3 from Android 14, this release works with QuickSwitch from Android 10 to Android 14! You won't need to use an older version to integrate with the system.

Some major highlights:
• Search your phone, the web, and more with our new <b>Global Search</b> — no root needed!¹
• View flight info, see surrounding traffic, and keep an eye on your data usage with <b>Smartspacer</b> — all integrated within Lawnchair.²
• Want to further control your icons? Fret not, We now support custom icon packs for themed icons, alongside some new icon options.³
• Themers rejoice — you can now <b>hide the Dock</b> for a cleaner home screen. You can also change even more colors, fonts, and padding.
• Are you tired of Lawnchair crashing because of widgets? We've fixed that issue; you won’t need to do some hacky workaround to add them.⁴

Alongside that, we have a new partnership with <a href="https://startpage.com">Startpage</a> — searching with Startpage (via the dock search bar or App Drawer search) helps support Lawnchair’s development.

We still have more things to share! See the <a href="https://lawnchair.app/blog/lawnchair-14">announcement on our website</a> for more information.
