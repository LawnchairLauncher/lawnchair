Lawnchair is a free, open-source home app for Android. Taking Launcher3 — Android’s default home app — as a starting point, it ports Pixel Launcher features and introduces rich options for customization.

This branch houses the codebase of Lawnchair 14, which is currently in beta and is based on Launcher3 from Android 14. For Lawnchair 9 to 13, see the branches with the `9-` to `13-` prefixes, respectively.

## Features

-   Pixel Launcher-like UI with Material You design
-   At a Glance widget with Smartspacer support
-   QuickSwitch support
-   Global Search support
-   Icons, fonts, and colors customization
-   And more!

## Download

See the [Releases](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/releases) section for the latest
beta build. For development builds with new icons, use the nightly builds.
