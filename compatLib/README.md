# Lawnchair Quickstep Compat Library

The `compatLib` library helps integrate Lawnchair with QuickSwitch while ensuring backward-compatibility with older Android versions.

Each subdirectory of the `compatLib`, denoted by a letter (e.g., `compatLibVQ` for Android 10), 
refers to the compatibility code for that specific Android version.

| Library     | Android version |
|-------------|-----------------|
| compatLibVQ | 10              |
| compatLibVR | 11              |
| compatLibVS | 12              |
| compatLibVT | 13              |
| compatLibVU | 14              |
