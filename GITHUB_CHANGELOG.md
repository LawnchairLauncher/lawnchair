Lawnchair 14 is here! Based on Launcher3 from Android 14, this release works with QuickSwitch from Android 10 to Android 14.
It includes the following features:

* GestureNavContract for no-root app closing animations;
* No-root Global Search: search your contacts, files, settings, and the web;
* Startpage as the new default search engine (read more on the blog above);
* Smartspacer support, a At a Glance alternative by @KieronQuinn;
* Custom icon shapes, alongside new predefined ones;
* Additional fonts support;
* Improved icon pack/themed icons picker by @naveenccmsd;
* More color, padding, and font customization options;
* Custom Home Feed support;
* Hide Dock support, and;
* Improved Settings UI with announcements section.

This release also fixes the bug where adding widgets with setup screens will crash Lawnchair.
It also includes miscellaneous bug fixes, new translations, and performance improvements.

As an added note, we would like to give a shout-out to @MrSluffy for doing the AOSP 13/14 merge to Lawnchair and reviving Lawnchair's development.
You may have known that Lawnchair development stalled into a hiatus after Patryk left and after we published 12.1 Alpha 4.
Thankfully, with them joining our team, they merged AOSP, added many new features, *and* fixed many issues with the app.

Weâ€™d like to give thanks to the following new contributors: @dhruvmaindola227, @Darkstar085 , @Fox2Code, @zjunior06, @AngelofVerdant, @MwMxdev.
