# About

The `components` directory should be organized into the following:

* For components for a specific UI that require many files, add it in a subdirectory. Example: `colorpreference`
* For components that allow the user to control/select something (a list, yes/no, etc), add it in the `controls` subdirectory.
* For components that are related to the layout itself and unrelated to the above, add it in the `layout` directory.
* Anything else, you can add it in the current `./` directory.
