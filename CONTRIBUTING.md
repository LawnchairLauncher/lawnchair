First and foremost, welcome to the **Lawnchair** Contributing Guidelines!

### üí´ Bug reports & feature requests

For bug reports, please describe the bug in detail to the best of your ability
and steps on how to reproduce it. If applicable, attach log files.

For feature requests, please describe the feature you'd like to see added to Lawnchair.
If applicable, attach log files.

Please make sure to be civil during discussion of your contribution (refer to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md))

### üåê Translation

For translation, visit [Lawnchair on Crowdin](https://lawnchair.crowdin.com) and follow these tips:

-   When using quotation marks, insert the symbols specific to the target language, as listed in this [this summary table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Summary_table);
-   Lawnchair uses title case for some English UI text while other languages do not use title case; opt for sentence case instead;
-   Some English terminology may have not have commonly-used equivalents in other languages. In such cases, use short descriptive phrases‚Äîfor example, the equivalent of _bottom row_ for _dock_;
-   Some languages (e.g. French) have variations of words depending if it's masculine or feminine (gender-specific); we recommend opting for gender-neutral words instead.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Code

> [!NOTE]
> For Lawnchair 9 to 13, see the branches with the `9-` to `13-` prefixes respectively.

For code, it's highly recommended that you use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio),
know [Java](https://www.java.com) or preferably [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can use Git to clone the repository; ensure that you include the project‚Äôs submodules using the `recursive` flag:
>
> ```
> git clone --recursive https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair.git
> ```

To build **Lawnchair**, select the `lawnWithQuickstepGithubDebug` build type.
Should you face errors relating to the `iconloaderlib` and `searchuilib` projects,
run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

Here are some contribution tips to help you get started:

-   Always make sure that you're up-to-date with **Lawnchair** by setting your base branch to `14-dev`.
-   Make sure your code is logical and well-formatted. If using Kotlin, see [‚ÄúCoding conventions‚Äù in the Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html);
-   [The `lawnchair` package](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/tree/14-dev/lawnchair) houses Lawnchair‚Äôs own code, whereas [the `src` package](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/tree/14-dev/src) includes a clone of the Launcher3 codebase with modifications. Generally, place new files in the former, keeping changes to the latter to a minimum.

#### Versioning scheme

As of [#4361](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/pull/4361),
Lawnchair‚Äôs version code is separated by four parts:

<p align="center">

        <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/version-dark.svg" width="98%">
        <img alt="" src="docs/version-light.svg" width="98%">
        <!-- Direct the accessibility reader to read the point below --->

</p>

1. Android's major version
2. Android's minor version
3. Lawnchair's development status
4. Lawnchair's development version

##### Android's major & minor versions

These make up the first two parts of the version code.
For example: Android 11 will be `11_00_XX_XX` while Android 12.1 will be `12_01_XX_XX`.

##### Development status & version

The third part of the version code indicates Lawnchair's stability status, while the fourth part indicates the version number.

For example, Alpha 4's version code will be `XX_XX_01_04`.

See the table below detailing the release type:

| Status            | Stage |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| Alpha             | 01    |
| Beta              | 02    |
| Release Candidate | 03    |
| Release           | 04    |
